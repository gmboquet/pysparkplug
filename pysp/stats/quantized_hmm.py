"""Create, estimate, and sample from a quantized hidden Markov model.

Defines the QuantizedHiddenMarkovModelDistribution and QuantizedHiddenMarkovEstimator classes for
use with pysparkplug.

Data type: Sequence[T] where T is a categorical emission value drawn from a finite set of levels.

A quantized HMM is an HMM with finite categorical emissions in which every probability in the model
is a power of a single shared base theta in (0, 1):

    (1) State transitions:      p_mat(Z_t = j | Z_{t-1} = i) = theta^k_trans[i, j] / Z_trans[i]
    (2) Emissions:              P(X_t = v | Z_t = i)         = theta^k_emit[i, v]  / Z_emit[i]
    (3) Initial states:         p_mat(Z_1 = j)               = theta^k_init[j]     / Z_init
                                (or the stationary distribution of (1), see init_mode)

where every exponent k is a non-negative integer and Z_row = sum_j theta^k[row, j] is the per-row
normalizer required because integer exponents with a single shared theta cannot sum to exactly one.
A negative exponent entry (-1) marks a structural zero: that transition/emission has probability 0.

Log-probabilities therefore take the form k * log(theta) - log(Z_row): a single integer multiply
plus one cached per-row float, so log <-> probability conversion is fast and the maximum-likelihood
parameters are naturally quantized (at theta = 1/2 the exponents are code lengths in bits).

Estimation fits within EM: the E-step is the ordinary Baum-Welch pass (reused unchanged from
pysp.stats.hidden_markov), while the M-step performs coordinate ascent on the expected
complete-data log-likelihood, alternating between (a) quantizing the unconstrained row MLEs to
integer exponents, k = round(log(p_hat) / log(theta)), and (b) a 1-d bounded maximization of

    f(theta) = sum_cells N * k * log(theta) - sum_rows N_row * log(Z_row(theta))

over theta. theta is shared by the transition, emission, and (when init_mode='quantized') initial
state blocks. Note that without a k_max cap the likelihood always improves as theta -> 1 (the
quantization grid becomes arbitrarily fine), so supply k_max (or fixed_theta) when a coarse,
meaningful quantization is wanted.

Because the M-step rounds probabilities to the theta^k grid, near-symmetric states produced by a
random initialization can round onto (nearly) identical grid points and leave EM at an exact fixed
point (dense HMM EM escapes such saddles by amplifying tiny count asymmetries, which quantization
erases). The raw expected counts still carry those asymmetries, so by default the estimator checks
after each M-step for state pairs whose quantized log-probabilities differ by less than split_nats
everywhere and pushes them split_nats apart along the strongest raw-count asymmetry
(split_collapsed=True), restoring a hill-climbing direction for the next E-step; an unwarranted
split is simply rounded back by the next M-step. Random restarts
(e.g. pysp.utils.estimation.best_of) remain useful for multimodality, as with any HMM.

If included, the length of the sequences is modeled through a length distribution with support on
non-negative integers.

        The E-step accumulates the standard Baum-Welch expected counts (reusing
        HiddenMarkovAccumulator with categorical emission accumulators). The M-step jointly fits
        the shared base theta and the integer exponent matrices by coordinate ascent on the
        expected complete-data log-likelihood.

        Args:
            num_states (int): Number of hidden states.
            levels (Optional[Sequence[Any]]): Emission support values to include in addition to the
                values observed in the data. Levels supplied here but never observed become
                structural zeros when pseudo_count is None.
            pseudo_count (Optional[float]): Per-cell pseudo count added to the initial, transition,
                and emission expected counts. When None (or 0), zero-count cells become structural
                zeros (probability 0).
            k_max (Optional[int]): Cap on the integer exponents; zero-count cells under a pseudo
                count and very rare events land on the probability floor theta^k_max. Without
                k_max, a free theta drifts toward 1 across EM iterations (ever finer quantization).
            fixed_theta (Optional[float]): If set, theta is held fixed (e.g. 0.5 for bit-length
                semantics) and only the integer exponents are estimated.
            init_mode (str): 'quantized' (initial states get their own theta^k row sharing theta)
                or 'stationary' (initial states are the stationary distribution of the fitted
                transition matrix).
            len_estimator (Optional[ParameterEstimator]): Optional ParameterEstimator for the
                sequence length distribution.
            name (Optional[str]): Set name to object instance.
            keys (Optional[Tuple[Optional[str], Optional[str], Optional[str]]]): Set keys for
                initial states, transition counts, and emission accumulators.
            use_numba (bool): If True, Numba is used for sequence encoding and vectorized functions.
            max_quant_its (int): Maximum coordinate-ascent iterations per theta starting point in
                the M-step.
            split_collapsed (bool): After each M-step, check for state pairs whose quantized
                parameters differ by less than split_nats everywhere and push them apart along the
                strongest raw expected-count asymmetry. Quantization otherwise rounds
                nearly-symmetric states onto (nearly) identical grid points, leaving EM at an
                exact fixed point that the raw counts say is escapable; an unwarranted split is
                rounded back by the next M-step.
            split_nats (float): Collapse tolerance and target separation (in nats of per-cell
                log-probability difference) for split_collapsed. Defaults to log(2).

        Attributes:
            num_states (int): Number of hidden states.
            levels (Optional[List[Any]]): Additional emission support values.
            pseudo_count (Optional[float]): Per-cell pseudo count.
            k_max (Optional[int]): Cap on the integer exponents.
            fixed_theta (Optional[float]): Fixed shared base, or None to optimize it.
            init_mode (str): Initial-state parameterization mode.
            len_estimator (ParameterEstimator): ParameterEstimator for the length distribution.
            name (Optional[str]): Name for object instance.
            keys (Tuple[Optional[str], Optional[str], Optional[str]]): Keys for initial states,
                transition counts, and emission accumulators.
            use_numba (bool): If True, Numba is used for sequence encoding.
            max_quant_its (int): Maximum coordinate-ascent iterations per starting point.
            split_collapsed (bool): If True, separate nearly-collapsed state pairs after each
                M-step.
            split_nats (float): Collapse tolerance and target separation in nats.
