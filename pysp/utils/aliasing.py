"""Backward-compatible keyword-argument aliasing for distribution and estimator constructors.

The distribution API is migrating toward descriptive public argument names (see
``notes/distribution_api_naming_accounting.md``). To keep existing code working while the
preferred spellings become canonical, constructors accept both the legacy name and the preferred
name and reconcile them with :func:`coalesce_alias`.

Usage::

    def __init__(self, components, w=None, name=None, *, weights=None):
        w = coalesce_alias('w', w, 'weights', weights)

The preferred (alias) argument is keyword-only so it never shadows a positional argument, and the
legacy argument keeps its position. Passing both raises ``TypeError``; passing neither raises
``TypeError`` for required arguments.
