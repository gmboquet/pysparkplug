"""Space-filling and classical experiment-design generators.

Every generator takes per-dimension ``bounds`` -- a sequence of ``(low, high)`` pairs -- and
returns a ``(n, d)`` numpy array of points scaled into those bounds. Random designs accept a
``seed`` (int or ``numpy.random.RandomState``) for reproducibility, matching the rest of pysp.
